    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <p class=storyText>Our Owner was inspired by roasting food over a fire when camping as a kid.
       What appealed to him was not only the tastiness of the food, but also the
        fact he didn't have to clean up any utensils after he was done eating.
        It is his mission to give to the world the same feelings of satisfaction he felt as a child.</p>
